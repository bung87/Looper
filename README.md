# looper  

Another web framework written in Nim  

build upon [chronos](https://github.com/status-im/nim-chronos.git) and serveral excellent projects.

`looper` will self contain manageable dependencies source code as much as posibble for accelerating development.  

`looper` current stage is proving my idea.
